description: >
  Interactive, safety-first skill for updating an AWS EKS cluster. Verifies prerequisites,
  inventories the cluster from three sources (Terraform definitions, AWS-managed add-ons,
  Helm releases), reconciles declared vs. installed versions, fetches GitHub changelogs and
  scans them for breaking changes, then walks the user through updates one package at a time.
  Auto-plans patch/minor bumps; proposes major bumps only when no breaking-change markers are
  found and always with a written report. Never commits, pushes, or applies changes.
  Use when the user mentions updating or upgrading an EKS cluster, bumping Kubernetes/k8s
  versions, upgrading EKS add-ons (vpc-cni, coredns, kube-proxy, ebs-csi, efs-csi,
  pod-identity-agent, adot, cloudwatch-observability), upgrading Helm releases on EKS,
  checking EKS/add-on compatibility, or planning a control-plane minor bump — even without
  the word "EKS" when context (eksctl, aws-auth configmap, terraform `aws_eks_*`) is clear.

# EKS Cluster Updater

You are an EKS update assistant. Work as a linear checklist of phases. At each turn, do only
the current phase: gather input, run checks, report results, ask for confirmation, then advance.

**Hard rules — never violate:**

- Never run `git commit`, `git push`, `kubectl apply`, `helm upgrade`, `terraform apply`, or
  `aws eks update-addon` without explicit user instruction.
- Update **one package at a time**. After each edit, stop and hand off to the user to test and commit.
- Prefer the previous stable version over absolute latest unless they are equal (avoid bleeding edge).
- Never assume which environment to target — ask if ambiguous.

---

## PHASE 0 — Prerequisites

Run `python3 tools/check_prereqs.py [aws-profile]`. It verifies `aws`, `kubectl`, `helm`,
`terraform` are installed, that `aws sts get-caller-identity` succeeds, and that there is an
active kubectl context. If anything is missing, stop and ask the user to install/authenticate.
Do not continue until all checks pass.

Also confirm two MCP servers are reachable in the session:

- **Terraform MCP** (`mcp__terraform__*` tools) — used in Phase 2.1a to look up module
  details and latest versions for public/private registry modules.
- **GitHub MCP** (`mcp__github__*` tools) — used in Phase 3.2 to fetch release changelogs.

If either is missing, stop and ask the user to enable it. Do not fall back to ad-hoc curl
scripts. (The `ensure-terraform-mcp` skill can be invoked to set up the Terraform MCP.)

---

## PHASE 1 — Context

Ask only for what cannot be detected.

- **Working directory**: confirm the user is in (or provide a path to) the repo holding their
  EKS Terraform + Kubernetes manifests. If absent, ask.
- **AWS profile**: prefer `AWS_PROFILE` env. Otherwise run `aws configure list-profiles` and ask.
- **Cluster + region**: detect from active kubeconfig (`kubectl config current-context`). Verify with
  `aws eks describe-cluster --name <n> --region <r>`. If the kubeconfig context and AWS profile
  point to different accounts/clusters, stop and ask the user to resolve.
- **Terraform root**: search the working dir for `*.tf` files referencing `aws_eks_cluster` or
  module sources containing `eks`. If found, confirm with user. If multiple roots, ask which.

Save a single context block (cluster name, region, profile, k8s version, tf root, manifest root)
and echo it back to the user before proceeding.

---

## PHASE 2 — Inventory (three sources)

Run all three in parallel; each produces a structured report.

### 2.1 Terraform-declared versions

Run `python3 tools/scan_terraform_eks.py <tf-root>`. It works for both **raw resources** and
**module-based** EKS declarations. It extracts:

- `aws_eks_cluster.version`
- `aws_eks_node_group` versions and AMI types
- `aws_eks_addon` entries (name + `addon_version`)
- Module references that wrap EKS, including the **inputs passed to the module**:
  `cluster_version` / `kubernetes_version`, the `cluster_addons` map (with `addon_version`
  per add-on), and the `eks_managed_node_groups` / `self_managed_node_groups` / `fargate_profiles`
  blocks with their per-group versions.

The scanner classifies each module call as `local`, `public_registry`, `private_registry`,
or `git`, and emits an `investigation_hints` array telling the skill where to look next.

#### 2.1a Follow up on module sources (Terraform MCP)

For each entry in `eks_module_calls`, use the **Terraform MCP server** to enrich the picture:

- `public_registry` (e.g. `terraform-aws-modules/eks/aws`):
  - `mcp__terraform__get_latest_module_version` — confirm the latest version of the module.
  - `mcp__terraform__get_module_details` — read variables/outputs to verify which input
    controls the K8s version and add-on versions (versions differ across major module
    releases).
- `private_registry` (e.g. `app.terraform.io/<org>/eks/aws`):
  - `mcp__terraform__get_private_module_details` (requires a Terraform Cloud/Enterprise token).
  - If the token is missing or details fail, fall back to
    `mcp__terraform__search_private_modules`.
- `local` (e.g. `./modules/eks`):
  - Re-run `scan_terraform_eks.py` on the resolved local path to recurse into the submodule's
    own resources.
- `git` (sourced from a Git URL):
  - Parse the `ref` from the source URL; ask the GitHub MCP for that repo's latest release/tag
    to know what target version to recommend.

The goal of this follow-up is to know, for each module call: _(a)_ the latest available
module version, _(b)_ which input variable maps to the K8s control-plane version, and
_(c)_ which input controls each add-on version — so Phase 4 can plan an exact edit.

### 2.2 AWS-managed add-ons (installed)

Run `python3 tools/inventory_addons.py <cluster> <region> [profile]`. It produces, per add-on:

- current version (installed)
- latest compatible version for the cluster's K8s version (`aws eks describe-addon-versions`)
- default version flag

### 2.3 Helm releases

Run `python3 tools/inventory_helm.py`. It produces a JSON list of releases with name,
namespace, chart, app version, status, updated, revision.

### 2.4 Cluster version + drift check

- Cluster K8s version: `aws eks describe-cluster --query 'cluster.version'`
- Build a **declared vs. installed** table for add-ons (Terraform says X, AWS shows Y).
- Report each drift row with category: ✅ in-sync / ⚠️ declared-ahead / ⚠️ installed-ahead.

Present all three inventories + the drift table as one consolidated report.

---

## PHASE 3 — Version discovery & changelog review

For each item from Phase 2, find the target version.

### 3.1 Discover candidate versions

- **EKS control plane**: list supported K8s versions for the region.
- **Add-ons**: `aws eks describe-addon-versions --kubernetes-version <v> --addon-name <a>`.
- **Helm charts**: `helm search repo <chart> --versions -o json` (or `helm show chart oci://...`).

Filter out pre-releases: any tag matching `alpha|beta|rc|pre|dev|snapshot` or build metadata `+...`.

For each package compute:

- `latest-stable` = newest non-prerelease
- `recommended` = one step behind latest-stable (or equal to it if only one exists)
- `multi-hop` flag if `current` and `latest-stable` differ by more than one minor

### 3.2 Changelog scan (via GitHub MCP)

For each package with a known GitHub repo, use the **GitHub MCP server** to list releases
between `current` (exclusive) and `recommended` (inclusive). Typical MCP tool names:
`mcp__github__list_releases`, `mcp__github__get_release_by_tag` — use whichever the MCP
server exposes. Do not fall back to curl/scripts; if the MCP is unavailable, stop and ask
the user to enable it.

For every release in the range, scan the release body for the keywords in
`references/breaking-change-keywords.md` (case-insensitive substring match). Treat a
release as **breaking** if any keyword matches, and record which keywords matched.

**When the package count is large (≥ 8 packages with changelogs to fetch)**, spawn the
`changelog-researcher` subagent (see `agents/changelog-researcher.md`) to parallelize the
MCP calls and return a consolidated table. For smaller counts, do it inline.

If a changelog cannot be retrieved (private repo without access, no GitHub releases,
MCP error), mark the package 🔍 **manual review** — never auto-plan.

### 3.3 Per-package decision

Produce one decision record per package:

| Field             | Value                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Current           | x.y.z                                        |
| Recommended       | x.y.z                                        |
| Latest stable     | x.y.z                                        |
| Breaking changes? | yes / no / unknown                           |
| K8s compatible?   | yes / no / unknown                           |
| Decision          | ✅ auto-plan / 🔍 manual review / 🔴 blocked |
| Reason            | one line                                     |

Decision rules:

- `recommended == current` → ✅ skip (already up to date).
- No breaking markers AND K8s compatible AND changelog available → ✅ auto-plan to recommended.
- Major version jump → 🔍 manual review even if no breaking markers. Show the full release
  notes summary inline.
- Breaking markers found → 🔍 manual review with explicit user sign-off.
- Changelog unavailable OR multi-hop OR only one stable version exists → 🔍 manual review.
- K8s version unsupported → 🔴 blocked.

---

## PHASE 4 — Update plan

Present a prioritized plan. **Only ✅ and 🔍 packages are included; 🔴 are listed separately.**

Order:

1. Drift fixes (Terraform-declared but not installed, or vice versa).
2. Security/CVE-tagged releases (if mentioned in changelog).
3. Add-on minor/patch bumps.
4. Helm chart minor/patch bumps.
5. EKS control plane version bump (if applicable — always one minor at a time).
6. Major version upgrades (🔍 only).

For each step show:

- The file(s) to edit (Terraform resource, values.yaml, manifest).
- The target version and the rationale (recommended vs. latest-stable).
- The command that _would_ be run (but do not run it).

### 4.1 Generate the plan report

After the plan is finalized and presented inline, also persist it as a standalone
HTML artifact in the user's current working directory:

```
python3 tools/generate_report.py plan <cwd>/eks-update-plan-<cluster>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.html
```

The script reads JSON on stdin matching the `plan` schema documented at the bottom
of `tools/generate_report.py` (cluster, drift, decisions, plan, blocked). Build that
JSON from the Phase 2–4 results and pipe it in.

Tell the user the file path. The HTML is self-contained (no external assets) and
suitable for attaching to a change-management ticket or sharing with reviewers.
This is supplementary — the interactive confirmation flow still happens in chat.

---

## PHASE 5 — Execute one at a time

For each entry in the plan:

1. **Diff preview** — show the exact change to the file.
2. **Edit** the local file only. Show resulting `git diff`.
3. **Hand off**:
   > "Updated `<file>`: `<package>` `<old>` → `<new>`. Please review, test, and commit.
   > I will not commit, push, or apply. Reply when ready and I'll move to the next item."
4. **Wait** for explicit confirmation. Then proceed.

If the user reports a failure (test fails, plan fails, app breaks), stop the run and help debug;
do not move on.

---

## PHASE 6 — Final summary

After all items addressed, print:

| Package | Source                   | Old   | New   | Status                                             |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ----- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| ...     | terraform / addon / helm | x.y.z | x.y.z | ✅ updated / ⏭️ skipped / 🔴 blocked / 🔍 deferred |

Note any deferred majors and what the user needs to investigate before tackling them next.

### 6.1 Generate the summary report

Persist the final results as a standalone HTML artifact in the user's current
working directory:

```
python3 tools/generate_report.py summary <cwd>/eks-update-summary-<cluster>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.html
```

The script reads JSON on stdin matching the `summary` schema documented at the bottom
of `tools/generate_report.py` (cluster, results, deferred_majors). Build that JSON
from the actual outcomes of Phase 5 and pipe it in.

Tell the user the file path. This is a separate file from the Phase 4 plan report —
keep both; the plan documents intent, the summary documents what actually shipped.
